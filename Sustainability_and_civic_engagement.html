            <h2>The trial of King Kong</h2>
            <p>This is an interactive drama designed to raise awareness of sexual and gender-based violence.
                It recounts real-life situations of abuse and offers an interactive analysis of the legal assessment
                of the facts and the penalties incurred. This play has given me a better understanding of certain harmful
                behaviours and the type of legal procedings imposed on these perpetrators.

            <p>
                This supervised activity aims to raise awareness of current climate and environmental issues through a 
                card game. The idea is to link these cards together in groups to stimulate reflection. This activity
                allowed me to synthesise my knowledge of ecology and connect the dots.
